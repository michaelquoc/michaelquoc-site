Architecture is not decoration; it is programming. Whether at my estate or our award-winning headquarters, I design spaces that enforce high-fidelity thought.

## 01 / The Synesthetic Standard
**Space is Software.** Just as bad code creates technical debt, bad architecture creates "Cognitive Debt." A messy sightline or discordant flow interrupts the background process of the mind.

## 02 / Utility as Art
**Form follows Purpose.** A space must serve its occupant. We reject empty minimalism in favor of "Functional Sovereignty."
