The ocean is a hostile environment that demands absolute calm. As a Rescue Diver, I use the underwater environment to train the mind for high-pressure scenarios.

## 01 / The Regulator Protocol
**Stop. Breathe. Think. Act.** This is the Rescue Diver's prime directive. When things go wrong, we override the instinct to bolt.

## 02 / Nature as System
Diving is not a sport; it is a meditation. It connects me to a biological system that existed long before algorithms.
