# The Physics of Music

*The Acoustics, Neuroscience & Evolutionary Biology*

47 axioms forged through the [ARC Protocol](/physics/arc-protocol/) (Adversarial Reasoning Cycle)

---

A single chord can make you cry. A drum beat can synchronize 50,000 strangers in a stadium. A lullaby can calm an infant who understands no words. Music has no calories, provides no shelter, cannot be mated with—yet every human culture in recorded history has created it, often at enormous cost of time and energy.

This is not magic. This is physics.

**Music is organized acoustic energy operating at the edge of thermodynamic equilibrium**—a low-entropy structure sustained through intentional energy injection, exploiting the mechanical properties of standing waves, cochlear filters, and neural oscillators. It hijacks ancient reward circuitry evolved for survival, triggers neurochemical cascades identical to food and sex, and coordinates human groups at scales impossible through grooming alone.

This article reveals the complete physics: 47 axioms across six research vectors, exposing why specific frequency ratios "sound good," how dopamine release is choreographed to musical structure, and what evolutionary problem music solved that justified its metabolic cost.

## How Does Sound Become Music? The Acoustic Physics

The first research vector attacked the physical layer: what distinguishes musical sound from noise at the level of vibrating air molecules? Seven axioms emerged.

### Why does music sound different from random noise?

**Axiom 1.1 - Music as Thermodynamic Anomaly.** Establishes that music represents a localized reversal of entropic decay—organized energy that should dissipate into randomness but doesn't. The Second Law of Thermodynamics dictates systems evolve toward maximum entropy. Noise exemplifies this: stochastic energy distributed across the frequency spectrum. Music exhibits the opposite: discrete power spectra with harmonics at integer multiples, stable limit cycles in phase space, and predictable temporal structure.

The distinction is quantifiable. Shannon entropy measures the average surprise in a signal. Musical structure occupies an intermediate zone—sufficient redundancy for pattern recognition, sufficient surprise for information content. Too predictable becomes boring; too random becomes noise. Music lives at the edge of chaos.

### What physically separates musical sound from speech or environmental noise?

**Axiom 1.2 - Spectral Discreteness as Musical Signature.** Reveals the fundamental marker: power spectra containing sharp peaks at integer-multiple frequencies versus continuous distributions.

The metric is Harmonic-to-Noise Ratio: HNR = 10 × log₁₀(Harmonic Power / Noise Power). Musical instruments exhibit greater than 20 dB HNR—meaning 99% of acoustic energy concentrates in discrete harmonics. This discreteness emerges from boundary condition physics: fixed endpoints on a vibrating string (Dirichlet conditions) permit only wavelengths λₙ = 2L/n, yielding exclusively integer-multiple frequencies.

A guitar string cannot vibrate at arbitrary frequencies. Physics constrains it to the harmonic series. This is why instruments "sing" while traffic noise drones.

### Why does a violin sound different from a flute at the same pitch?

**Axiom 1.5 - Timbre as Dual-Dimensional Identity.** Explains that instrument recognition operates on two timescales: the attack transient (first ~50ms entropy spike) identifies the excitation mechanism; the steady-state spectral envelope identifies resonator geometry.

Remove the attack transient from a trumpet recording and listeners cannot distinguish it from a violin—despite completely different steady-state spectra. The "brightness" of a trumpet versus the "warmth" of a cello lives in those first 50 milliseconds. The bow scraping string, the hammer striking wire, the breath exciting reed: each creates a unique spectral signature during the attack phase before standing waves organize.

### Why do some note combinations sound "good" while others clash?

**Axiom 1.4 - Consonance as Interference Minimization.** Demonstrates that consonance is mechanical, not cultural—a direct consequence of cochlear filter physics.

The inner ear contains roughly 3,500 hair cells arrayed along the basilar membrane, each tuned to respond to a narrow frequency band. When two frequencies fall within the same critical bandwidth (approximately ERB(f) = f/9.265 + 24.7 Hz), they create amplitude modulation perceived as roughness. Maximum roughness—maximum dissonance—occurs at frequency separation of approximately 0.25 times the critical bandwidth.

Wave superposition produces amplitude modulation at beat frequency |f₁ - f₂|. Below 15 Hz, we hear distinct pulses. Between 15-300 Hz within critical bandwidth, we perceive roughness. Above 200 Hz separation, frequencies fuse into perceived consonance.

The octave (2:1 ratio) creates zero critical-band collisions between harmonics. The minor second (16:15 ratio) creates extensive beating. Consonance hierarchies are not aesthetic preferences—they are engineering constraints imposed by cochlear architecture.

### What makes a rhythm feel "groovy" versus mechanical?

**Axiom 1.6 - Rhythm as Phase Synchronization.** Reveals that groove emerges from stable micro-timing deviations (10-50ms systematic lags), not metronomic precision.

Kuramoto oscillator models predict that human timing exhibits 1/f noise—the signature of criticality, the boundary between order and chaos where neural entrainment maximizes. Perfectly robotic timing lacks this 1/f structure. The "swing" in jazz, the "push" in funk: these are systematic temporal perturbations that maintain the listener at the edge of predictability.

The physics is universal: any system of coupled oscillators exhibits phase synchronization above critical coupling strength. Music exploits this to entrain neural populations across multiple brains simultaneously.

## Why Does Music Trigger Emotion? The Neural Mechanics

The second vector investigated the brain's response: why does organized sound produce reward and emotion despite having no survival value? Seven axioms emerged.

### Does music actually cause dopamine release, or just correlate with it?

**Axiom 2.1 - Dopaminergic Causality.** Establishes music requires dopamine as causal antecedent, not mere correlation. The pharmacological evidence is definitive: Levodopa (dopamine precursor) enhances hedonic response to music; Risperidone (D2 antagonist) produces musical anhedonia—perception remains intact but reward is stripped away.

The conversion of acoustic structure into subjective value is exclusively dopaminergic. Auditory cortex processing remains unchanged under D2 antagonism; emotional valuation is eliminated. Musical pleasure uses the same neurochemical currency as food, sex, and addictive drugs—hijacking ancient survival circuitry with organized sound.

### When exactly does dopamine release during music listening?

**Axiom 2.2 - Two-Phase Dopamine Architecture.** Reveals anatomical specificity: anticipation activates the dorsal striatum (caudate) approximately 15 seconds before peak emotional moments; consummation activates the ventral striatum (nucleus accumbens) at resolution.

This mirrors Kent Berridge's distinction between "wanting" and "liking"—separate neural circuits for motivation and hedonic impact. The separation explains why musical build-up is pleasurable independent of resolution: the anticipation phase generates its own reward.

Quantification from PET imaging: 6-9% increase in striatal dopamine binding potential during peak musical pleasure versus neutral music. Less than cocaine. More than food. Music occupies a specific position in the reward hierarchy.

### What determines if someone will get "chills" from music?

**Axiom 2.7 - Musical Frisson Cascade.** Identifies the psychophysiological marker of peak reward: convergence of prediction error, dopamine surge, and autonomic arousal. Triggers include sudden dynamic changes, appoggiaturas, unexpected modulations, and new voice entrances.

**Axiom 2.5 - White Matter Architecture.** Reveals the structural prerequisite: musical reward sensitivity maps to tract integrity connecting Superior Temporal Gyrus to Nucleus Accumbens. Lower Fractional Anisotropy in Arcuate Fasciculus = signal generated but never arrives at reward center.

Approximately 5% of the population exhibits musical anhedonia—they perceive music accurately but derive no pleasure. Their auditory cortices function normally; their white matter connections are reduced. Conversely, hyper-hedonia (frequent chills) correlates with greater white matter volume connecting auditory cortex, insula, and medial prefrontal cortex.

Your capacity for musical ecstasy is partially anatomical.

### Why does music trigger memories so powerfully?

**Axiom 2.6 - The Parahippocampal Gateway.** Explains that music accesses autobiographical memory via a distinct neural route preserved in neurodegeneration—the Right Parahippocampal Gyrus, independent of hippocampus proper.

The "reminiscence bump" (music from ages 10-30 triggering the strongest memories) is explained by heightened adolescent ventral striatum reactivity. Stronger dopamine during the music-learning period creates more durable music-memory associations. This is why Alzheimer's patients who cannot recognize family members can still sing songs from their youth: the parahippocampal pathway degrades more slowly than hippocampal circuits.

### What is the optimal level of musical surprise?

**Axiom 2.3 - Entropy-Weighted Sweet Spot.** Formalizes the relationship: musical pleasure follows an inverted U-function relating Information Content to reward, modulated by contextual Entropy.

In low-entropy contexts (high certainty), small deviations trigger significant reward—violations are salient. In high-entropy contexts (high uncertainty), only massive deviations penetrate the noise floor. Two specific reward scenarios emerge: high surprise + high certainty = "sweet surprise"; low surprise + high uncertainty = uncertainty reduction satisfaction.

The brain is not rewarding surprise per se. It rewards **precision-weighted** surprise—the right amount of unexpected given what was expected.

## Why Does Music Exist? The Evolutionary Puzzle

The third vector attacked the deepest question: why did music survive natural selection? Eight axioms emerged.

### Isn't music just "auditory cheesecake"—pleasure without purpose?

**Axiom 3.1 - The Metabolic Paradox.** Confronts the challenge directly. Music violates natural selection predictions: consuming vast metabolic energy without obvious survival benefit, yet persisting as an absolute human universal. Every known culture makes music. None have abandoned it.

The costs are real: caloric expenditure, opportunity cost, predation risk from noise production, cognitive overhead. Steven Pinker famously called music "auditory cheesecake"—a pleasure technology exploiting systems evolved for other purposes, providing no fitness benefit.

But **Axiom 3.2 - The Neanderthal Problem.** Challenges this dismissal. The Divje Babe flute—if confirmed as Neanderthal-made—dates to 50,000-60,000 years ago, before anatomically modern humans arrived in Europe. Micro-CT scans reveal rotation marks incompatible with carnivore damage. If Neanderthals made music, it represents either deep homology (500,000+ years old) or convergent evolution implying strong selective pressure.

Expensive behaviors that persist across 500 millennia are not typically explained as purposeless byproducts.

### Did music evolve for sexual selection like the peacock's tail?

**Axiom 3.4 - Sexual Selection Paradox.** Presents large-scale evidence contradicting Darwin's courtship hypothesis. A Swedish twin study (N=10,975) found musical aptitude and mating success **negatively** associated.

Supporting evidence exists—Marin & Rathgeber demonstrated priming effects of music on attractiveness ratings. But a fatal flaw undermines the theory: both sexes sing and dance; music is fundamentally communal rather than competitive in hunter-gatherer societies. The peacock's tail is male-only. Music is universal.

Sexual selection likely represents secondary exaptation rather than primary driver.

### What evolutionary problem did music actually solve?

**Axiom 3.3 - Neurochemical Precision of Bonding.** Reveals the answer: music exploits the mammalian endorphin-oxytocin system evolved for physical grooming, achieving exponential efficiency gains.

Robin Dunbar's constraint: grooming is dyadic and time-limited; primate groups beyond ~50-80 individuals exceed capacity for pairwise bonding maintenance. Music represents a breakthrough—"vocal grooming" allowing one individual to "groom" many simultaneously.

**Axiom 3.5 - The Lullaby Universal.** Suggests the origin point: the "altricial dilemma." Human infants are extremely helpless, creating selection pressure for acoustic affect regulation—the "vocal tether" allowing caregivers to soothe infants without physical contact. Lullabies universally share acoustic characteristics: slow tempo, descending pitch, narrow range, repetition. Newborns 2-3 days old detect beats via EEG; infants prefer consonance by 4 months—before cultural learning could explain the preference.

Pinker himself endorsed this as "the first explanation that makes evolutionary sense."

### How did music evolve if it wasn't a single adaptation?

**Axiom 3.8 - Mosaic Evolution Framework.** Proposes music assembled from different evolutionary parts at different times:

1. **Affective Core** (mammalian bonding circuits)
2. **Meticulous Mimic** (hominid vocal control)  
3. **Social Glue** (Paleolithic vocal grooming)
4. **Sexual Display** (co-opted courtship signaling)
5. **Cultural Feedback** (gene-culture coevolution)

Even if music began as cultural invention (like fire), its utility was so profound it created feedback loops reshaping the human organism. The 40,000-year-old Swabian Jura flutes represent sophisticated craftsmanship implying centrality to survival strategy—not idle entertainment.

## Why Does Tension-Resolution Feel Good? The Information Theory

The fourth vector investigated music as pattern and expectation. Eight axioms emerged.

### What computational process creates musical pleasure?

**Axiom 4.1 - Precision-Weighted Prediction Error.** Formalizes the mechanism: Musical pleasure is not detection of prediction errors but **precision-weighted resolution**. Reward scales with |Prediction Error| × Precision.

The brain continuously generates predictions about incoming sensory data. When predictions are violated, prediction error signals propagate. But raw prediction error is not inherently rewarding—noise would be maximally pleasurable.

The key is precision: the brain's confidence in its predictions. High precision (low contextual entropy) means small violations generate large rewards—because violations are salient against certain expectations. Low precision (high contextual entropy) requires massive violations to penetrate noise.

**Axiom 4.4 - Hierarchical Bayesian Statistical Learning.** Explains how predictions form: implicit statistical learning across multiple timescales. The IDyOM model integrates long-term model (cultural priors) with short-term model (piece-specific adaptation). You learn the statistics of Western harmony through exposure; you learn the statistics of this specific piece through listening.

### Why does repetition feel good in music but boring elsewhere?

**Axiom 4.7 - Repetition as Prior-Building Infrastructure.** Resolves the paradox: repetition is not redundancy but infrastructure. It builds high-precision priors that set the stage for maximal surprise impact.

The temporal dynamics follow three phases:
- **Phase 1** (initial): high prediction error, high cognitive load, moderate pleasure
- **Phase 2** (repeated): decreasing prediction error, increasing fluency, increasing pleasure
- **Phase 3** (over-exposure): near-zero prediction error, minimal information content, decreasing pleasure

Peak pleasure occurs when learning rate is maximized—the steepest descent of the prediction error curve. Later segments often have higher Information Content despite repetition because evolving context makes differences salient.

### Why does the urge to move to music feel involuntary?

**Axiom 4.8 - Groove as Active Inference.** Explains: we don't move **because** of the beat; we move **to create** the beat. The motor system generates actions to minimize prediction error, imposing predictability on uncertainty.

Tapping generates proprioceptive signals fed back into the auditory prediction system. Motor signal increases precision of temporal predictions—higher precision makes deviations more salient. 2025 EEG studies showed tapping to syncopated rhythms increased Mismatch Negativity amplitude compared to passive listening.

Groove is not passive reception. It is active participation in prediction verification.

### Why does sad music feel pleasurable?

**Axiom 4.6 - Active Interoceptive Inference.** Provides the mechanism: music is processed as signal from "virtual body." The brain performs pseudo-interoception, simulating bodily changes to match music's implied arousal state.

A slow cello melody is processed as "voice sighing"—low respiratory rate, descending prosodic contour. The brain aligns interoceptive state to this virtual body, generating feeling of sadness without semantic content. The pleasure comes not from the sadness itself but from the **successful alignment**—the reduction of interoceptive prediction error.

You are not sad because the music is sad. You are simulating sadness because the music's acoustic properties resemble the acoustic properties of sad vocalization, and successful simulation is intrinsically rewarding.

## Why Do Groups Make Music Together? The Social Physics

The fifth vector examined music's social function. Nine axioms emerged.

### What happens in the brain when people make music together?

**Axiom 5.1 - Neural Entrainment Creates Synchronized Clocks.** Reveals that music operates through automatic synchronization of brain oscillations to rhythmic stimuli. fNIRS shows measurable interpersonal neural synchronization during synchronized movement—different brains literally oscillating in phase.

Basal ganglia and supplementary motor areas align to common temporal framework at approximately 2 Hz (~120 BPM). This creates a "shared neurophysiological clock" persisting beyond immediate musical context. The brain prepares to move before conscious decision—suppressing movement to strong beat requires active inhibition.

### Why does dancing together feel so bonding?

**Axiom 5.2 - Endogenous Opioid Reward for Synchronization.** Demonstrates the neurochemical mechanism. Robin Dunbar's protocol: singing/dancing/drumming elevates pain thresholds (endorphin proxy); passive listening shows no effect; Naltrexone (opioid antagonist) eliminates the elevation, confirming endorphin causality.

Physical exertion plus interpersonal synchrony produces multiplicative effect—the "runner's high" of synchronized dancers is the same endorphin release that makes painful labor bearable.

**Axiom 5.5 - Self-Other Merging.** Explains the subjective experience: synchronized movement creates temporary identity fusion. When own actions match another's in real-time, mirror neuron systems activate identically for execution and observation. The brain has difficulty distinguishing self from other.

Measured effects: increased Inclusion of Other in Self scores, enhanced prosociality in economic games. Most remarkably: 14-month-old infants bounced in synchrony with an adult subsequently help that adult more—pre-verbal social technology operating before language acquisition.

### Why is music present in virtually all rituals?

**Axiom 5.4 - Coalition Signaling as Honest Signal.** Applies Zahavi's Handicap Principle: group musical performance evolved as credible signal to external observers because synchronized music is inherently difficult, requiring joint attention, anticipatory coordination, and impulse suppression.

Synchronized versus asynchronous marchers are rated as more formidable by observers. BaYaka hunter-gatherer women sang more in large groups with unfamiliar members; close kin preferred talking. Music broadcasts: "We are organized, many, and prepared."

The message is directed **outward**—not just bonding participants but signaling collective capacity to observers. Military music, war dances, religious ceremonies: all leverage music's capacity to demonstrate coordination.

### Can music be weaponized?

**Axiom 5.9 - Weaponized Sound.** Acknowledges the dark side: the same pathways that create group cohesion enable manipulation and division. Mechanisms include normalization (maintaining "civilized" status while committing atrocities), inoculation (artistic prestige shielding state criticism), economic hard power (streaming revenues funding adversary budgets), and algorithmic propaganda (trending audio as identity marker).

Most extremely: music torture overloads pleasurable pathways to create psychological damage. The same systems that generate euphoria can be driven into aversive states through forced overstimulation.

---

## Why Do Specific Intervals Sound "Right"? The Mathematical Structure

The sixth vector examined harmonic mathematics. Ten axioms emerged.

### Are consonance preferences cultural or biological?

**Axiom 6.9 - Three-Component Consonance Model.** Synthesizes decades of research: consonance requires three components operating together:

1. **Roughness avoidance** (universal, cochlear physics)
2. **Harmonicity preference** (learned through exposure)
3. **Slow beat preference** (creates perceived "warmth")

A 2024 study collected 235,440 consonance judgments and found neither roughness nor harmonicity alone explains preferences. When spectra are artificially "stretched" (γ = 2.1), consonance preferences shift accordingly. With bonang-like timbres, Western participants preferred inharmonic intervals matching Indonesian scales.

**Axiom 6.1 - Spectral Determinism.** Formalizes this: consonance is function of timbre, not mathematics alone. The Javanese bonang produces "consonant" intervals at non-integer ratios matching its inharmonic partials. The scale is a function of the instrument.

The biology provides constraints; culture determines which solutions are selected.

### Why does the octave feel like "the same note"?

**Axiom 6.8 - Octave Equivalence as Cultured Biology.** Reveals surprising complexity. A 2024 rat study found rats trained on melody recognized octave transposition but failed non-octave (tritone) transposition—suggesting mammalian biological predisposition.

But the Tsimané people of Bolivia show no octave equivalence, treating octave-related pitches as different notes entirely. Hardware provides potential; software determines realization. Octave equivalence is biological predisposition requiring cultural activation.

### Why do most cultures use 5-7 note scales?

**Axiom 6.6 - Maximally Even Sets.** Provides the mathematical answer: scales of 5-7 notes from 12 chromatic positions reflect geometric optimization. The diatonic scale (7 from 12) yields the unique W-W-H-W-W-W-H pattern possessing Myhill's Property: every generic interval comes in exactly two sizes.

**Axiom 6.10 - 5-7 Note Convergence.** Adds constraints: cross-cultural convergence reflects harmonicity optimization, vocal imprecision (~155 cents typical), and working memory limits (7±2 items). Only approximately 1% of mathematically possible scales appear globally.

But caution is warranted: pentatonic failed >50% prevalence threshold for "universals" in large-scale analysis. Within-culture variation (Carnatic music has 72 parent scales) can equal between-culture variation.

### Why is perfect tuning mathematically impossible?

**Axiom 6.4 - The Pythagorean Comma.** Demonstrates the fundamental impossibility: the cycle of fifths spirals infinitely because 3^m ≠ 2^(n+m) for any integers. Stack twelve perfect fifths and you overshoot seven octaves by 23.46 cents—the "Pythagorean comma."

**Axiom 6.5 - Equal Temperament as Logarithmic Compromise.** Explains the solution: 12-TET divides octave into 12 equal semitones (ratio 2^(1/12) ≈ 1.0595). Every interval except octave is slightly detuned. The major third is 13.69 cents sharp compared to just intonation.

Remarkably: 2024 research found listeners **prefer** slight detuning over pure ratios. The slow beats (1-8 Hz) created by tempered intervals are perceived as "warmth." Pure just intervals sound "sterile." Musical aesthetics evolved to prefer the mathematical compromise—the "flaws" are features.

---

## The Complete Music Equation

**Musical Value = (Physical Constraints × Neural Processing × Social Function) / Metabolic Cost**

Where:

- **Physical Constraints** = standing wave physics, critical bandwidth biology, number theory
- **Neural Processing** = precision-weighted prediction error × dopaminergic reward × white matter connectivity
- **Social Function** = entrainment efficiency × endorphin release × coalition signaling value
- **Metabolic Cost** = energy expenditure + opportunity cost + predation risk

Music persists when the numerator exceeds the denominator. Human evolution discovered that organized sound—properly engineered—generates social coordination benefits exceeding all costs.

## The Five Iron Laws

### Iron Law I: The Entropy Boundary

Music exists at the critical point between order and chaos. Too predictable is boring; too random is noise. The optimal information content scales with contextual entropy—the brain rewards appropriate surprise given established expectations. (**Axioms 1.1, 1.7, 2.3, 4.1, 4.5**)

### Iron Law II: The Dopaminergic Hijack

Musical pleasure uses survival circuitry. The reward systems evolved for food, sex, and social bonding respond identically to organized sound meeting specific acoustic criteria. This is not metaphor—it is shared neurochemistry. (**Axioms 2.1, 2.2, 2.7, 5.2**)

### Iron Law III: The Cochlear Veto

The ear imposes absolute constraints. Critical bandwidth determines consonance; frequency resolution limits harmonic discrimination; temporal integration windows bound rhythm perception. No cultural practice can override basilar membrane physics. (**Axioms 1.2, 1.4, 6.2**)

### Iron Law IV: The Coordination Imperative

Music evolved because groups that could synchronize through sound outcompeted those that couldn't. Neural entrainment creates shared physiological clocks; endorphins reward synchronized exertion; coalition signaling broadcasts collective capacity. (**Axioms 3.3, 3.5, 3.7, 5.1, 5.4**)

### Iron Law V: The Cultural Lens

Biology provides possibilities; culture selects solutions. Octave equivalence, scale structure, consonance preferences all show biological constraints with cultural realization. Universal tendencies exist within substantial variation. (**Axioms 6.8, 6.9, 6.10**)

---

## Frequently Asked Questions About Music and the Brain

### Why do some people not enjoy music at all?

**Axioms 2.1 and 2.5** explain the phenomenon. Musical anhedonia (~5% of population) reflects reduced structural integrity in white matter tracts connecting Superior Temporal Gyrus to Nucleus Accumbens. Auditory processing remains intact; reward signal never arrives. It is not a failure of taste but of neural wiring.

### Why do we get goosebumps from music?

**Axiom 2.7** identifies musical frisson as peak reward marker—convergence of prediction error, dopamine surge, and autonomic arousal. The piloerection (goosebumps) is sympathetic nervous system activation accompanying strong NAcc response. Triggers include sudden dynamic shifts, appoggiaturas, unexpected harmonies, and new voice entrances.

### Is the preference for consonance learned or innate?

Both, per **Axioms 1.4, 6.2, and 6.9**. Roughness avoidance is universal (cochlear physics). Harmonicity preference and slow-beat preference are shaped by cultural exposure. The biology sets boundaries; experience determines preferences within those boundaries.

### Why is 120 BPM such a common tempo?

**Axiom 5.1** explains: ~2 Hz (~120 BPM) corresponds to optimal neural entrainment frequency for basal ganglia and supplementary motor areas. This tempo creates maximal motor preparation with minimal cognitive effort. It also approximates human walking cadence.

### Why does music help us remember things?

**Axiom 2.6** identifies the parahippocampal gateway: music accesses autobiographical memory through a distinct route preserved in neurodegeneration. The Right Parahippocampal Gyrus processes contextual "where" and "when" information. Music-memory associations formed during high-dopamine periods (adolescence) are especially durable.

### Can animals appreciate music?

**Axiom 6.8** notes rats recognize octave transposition, suggesting basic pitch processing. But music appreciation requires prediction error reward systems calibrated to specific statistical regularities. Species with different cochlear architecture, different critical bandwidths, different harmonic exposure would experience "music" differently—if at all.

### Why does sad music feel good?

**Axiom 4.6** explains active interoceptive inference: the brain simulates bodily states matching music's implied arousal. A slow, descending melody triggers "sadness simulation" without actual threat or loss. The pleasure comes from successful alignment—not from the negative emotion itself but from the efficient prediction of it.

### Why do humans but not chimps make music?

**Axiom 3.3** identifies the critical difference: humans needed coordination mechanisms for groups exceeding grooming capacity (~150 individuals). Chimps maintain bonds through physical grooming, limiting group size. Human music represents vocal grooming scaled—one individual can "groom" hundreds simultaneously. The selective pressure simply didn't exist for chimps.

### What makes a song "catchy"?

**Axiom 4.7** on repetition dynamics, combined with **Axiom 2.3** on entropy-weighted sweet spots: catchy songs establish predictions quickly (simple patterns, repetition) then violate them precisely at optimal surprise levels. The hook creates high-precision expectations; the variation delivers exactly enough prediction error to maximize reward.

### Why do we like the music we heard as teenagers?

**Axiom 2.6** on the reminiscence bump: heightened adolescent ventral striatum reactivity creates stronger dopamine-mediated memory encoding. Music heard during this period binds more tightly to autobiographical memory. It's not nostalgia in a vague sense—it's neurochemically privileged encoding.
